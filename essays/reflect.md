Starting my journey with JavaScript has been a rollercoaster of emotions and experiences. As a newcomer to the language, I've encountered both frustration and enlightenment as I navigate the intricacies of this programming language. While it may not be my favorite language to work with, I've come to appreciate the unique challenges it presents and the growth it has sparked in me.

One of the initial challenges I faced with JavaScript is the need to type out every piece of code, including reserved identifiers. Coming from a background in languages like Java, C/C++, and Python, where some level of automation is available, this aspect of JavaScript felt laborious and time-consuming. The fear of making typos and syntax errors loomed over me as I attempted to write clean and functional code.

However, delving into ES6 (ECMAScript 6) proved to be a game-changer. This latest version of JavaScript introduced me to a whole new set of features and functionalities that I had never encountered before. The arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals were like pieces of a puzzle falling into place. While still challenging, ES6 opened my eyes to the power and flexibility that JavaScript has to offer.

Despite my initial reservations, the practice of WODs (Workout of the Day) has been instrumental in my learning journey. These exercises not only prepared me for the class WODs but also allowed me to get a taste of the real-world challenges that I could potentially face as a software engineer. While the pressure of timed quizzes can be daunting, they have pushed me to think on my feet and apply my knowledge in a fast-paced environment.


Adapting to this learning style has been a process in itself. The uncertainty of what to expect in class and the constant need to stay on top of new concepts can be overwhelming. However, the excitement of exploring new languages and concepts keeps me motivated. I am especially eager to create and share a website with the public, showcasing my newfound skills and creativity.


As I continue to navigate the challenges of JavaScript, I am optimistic that this learning approach will ultimately work in my favor. I've taken a proactive approach to time management, dedicating extra hours to fully grasp the concepts at hand. While there will undoubtedly be moments of stress and frustration, the satisfaction of learning something new and the potential for personal growth far outweigh the challenges.

In conclusion, my journey with JavaScript has been a mixture of ups and downs, but I am determined to persevere. From conquering the fear of typos to embracing the power of ES6, each experience has contributed to my growth as a software engineer. With an open mind and a willingness to adapt, I am confident that I will continue to conquer challenges and emerge stronger on the other side.
