For my final project for my ICS 211 class, I was in a group of three to create a fishing game. The rules for this game were:
1) Two players will alternate turns on the same computer
2) The players will catch fish and put them into a “sack” (an ArrayList, sorted in descending order by length)
3) If the fish is caught, the player will then need to decide whether or not to keep it
4) After 12 turns each, the player with the three largest fish is the winner

MoiLi_i, Oama, Ohua, and Pua_ama are the name of the fish families we used (these were the parent classes). From this project, I learned a lot about Java, such as inheritance, working with abstract classes, interfaces, etc. This project also taught me a lot about teamwork and how to work together with a group of people for coding.
